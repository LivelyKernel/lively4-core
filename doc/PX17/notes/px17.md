 # PX17.2 Fly on the Wall Notes


- HTML was quite life, but newer technologies / frameworks aren't
- Abstractions mess things up
- Student + PL researcher -> "desperate audience"
- Main audience: ground who builds this
- Work impact: -> become of interest to a different group
- Lessons: livelyness is a responisibility of the programmer
- Technical ingredients
    - Schema evolution
    - Morphic interaction style
    - Migrations
- Deeper solution: solve in chrome?
- CLOS object migration
    - initialization
    - self transporter
- When to do object migration
    - finding existing instances
    - vs. "stumble across them"
    - objects might might be many steps behind (also RW for Lively Groups)
- Identity is not as relevant in JavaScript
    - identity is used as "---"
- Contribution
    - making it available to the publi
- Paper: opens with components, but does not close with it
- abstract: imposing restrictions? -> paper does not go in that direction
- Contribution: motivational part
    - Goal of the paper: Web-components static thing -> more dynamic
- Rhetorical style: 4 levels of abstraction at a given time ...
