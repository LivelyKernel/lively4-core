## Hash-tag Navigation

Immediatly transform all Hashtags in lively-container and ace editors into active links that open a context menu with actual links to the various sites.

The links have to be provideded by a service (nodejs or service worker), they should either be updated actively after chaning conent or generated by a search bot... e.g. can we use travis for this? We would ideally not store the results back into the same repository. 

Means for storing the links:

- one file in file system
- elastic search or similar service (fulltext search possible)
- any key value store
