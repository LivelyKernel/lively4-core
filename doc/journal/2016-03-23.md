Our chrome extension has a new friend... a custom code editor in Lively4! 

A new context menu entry "Customize Page" opens a workspace that allows to edit code that is run for every page under that domain. As a test I modified my private amazon page, listing all my bought things on that page on a workspace... only 10 and not all, but it is a start. I picked that information because different to other typical information on a website, this content lies behind some authentification barriers that are hard to get through on a command line. I cannot simply paste the url and do some "curl", "grep" and "sed" magic. But using Lively I can start to get the information right from the original page. 

```JS
lively.array($('h1'))
	.filter(ea => ea.textContent.match("Meine Bestellungen")).forEach( ea => {
		ea.style.backgroundColor ="gray"
		ea.title = "Lively4: Open as workspace"
		ea.onclick = evt => {
			var text = lively.array($(".a-link-normal"))
				.filter(ea => ea.href.match(/product/))
				.map(ea => ea.textContent.replace(/\n/g,"").replace(/ +/," "))
				.filter(ea => ea.match(/[^ ]/))
				.join("\n")
			lively.openWorkspace(text, evt).then( comp => 
				comp.changeMode("text"));
		}
})
```

At the moment this script is not different from any page monkey patching, but it is one step further of #Astrid's dream of persistently customizing her facebook page, just by deleting some elements and moving others around. We have moving and deleting now and we have a simple form of persitence per page (or in this case per domain). We just need it now to bring together!

Any volunteers?
