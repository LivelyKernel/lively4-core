- found code for [embding clickable links into ace](http://jsbin.com/jehopaja/4/edit?html,output)
rch-index)

- it support server and client side indexing and search
- the seach index is persistent 
- the index can be moved between client and server 
- the index can be backed up in a file, e.g we can store it in a dropbox

This should allow us to combine personal but still private lively search experience for all the different resources a user has access to!

Also thinking about using PDF.js for displaying papers and its annotations... #PDFJS
