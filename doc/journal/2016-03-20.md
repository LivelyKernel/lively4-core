Embedding other pages is difficult. The X-Frame-Options header in many responses (e.g. from Google, Facebook) indicate to the browser that it shouldn't show the page in an iframe or object tag. We cannot remove that tag from the response with the service worker, because iframe and object requests do not pass through the service worker.

## Idea #Jens

But, Robert Krahn proposed that we can control such flags when we pass all request through our own proxy, as we did often had to do in Lively Kernel any way. Sp in principal instead of browsing http://google.com directly, we go through http://ourproxy.com/google.com.

But could we do so when initialy going through that proxy any way? Since we opened a service worker on a specific domain, e.g. https://lively-kernel.github.io/lively4-core/. And we install a service worker for a domain. Then opening a page under  https://lively-kernel.github.io/lively4-core/proxy/* should go through a service worker if that service worker is running, or not?
