```HTML
<div style="width: 238px; height: 115px; position: relative; max-width: none; max-height: none; left: 28px; top: 22px; background-color: blue;" id="foo"><button style="left: 132px; top: 46px;">Color</button></div>
```

```JavaScript
that.innerHTML = "<button>Color</button>"
that.

System.import
that.id = "foo"

that.style.backgroundColor = "gray"
that.id = "tosave"
that.v = 3

that.v = 4
lively.showElement(get('#tosave'))

get('#tosave').innerHTML 

get("foo")


window.get = (name ) => document.querySelector(name)
HTMLElement.get = function(name ) { document.querySelector("#" +name)

get('tosave')
```


### Nice use case of #Lively4Chrome...

I had to get the list of our mailinglist subsribers...
So I went to its website. I could not find an export link, but just the list as an HTML table...

So I opened a Workspace and wrote a little script.

```
_.select(_.map($("td"), ea => ea.textContent), ea => ea.match(/@/)).join("\n")
```

I don't do this very often, but I would like to be able to add a persistent button on that specific page, that everytime I go there I will have it easier to get the plain list.
