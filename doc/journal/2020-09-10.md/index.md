## 2020-09-10 Custom URLs.... read and write?
*Author: @JensLincke*

Using our #PolymorphicIdentifier / custom URLs,  such as <bib://Taeumel2016EUI>, <author://Jens Lincke>, or <keyword://COP> one explore the bibliography in an very interactive way... But what about using the URLs for scripting and what about modifying the content? E.g. changing the bibliography entry? Or creating new ones? We should hide it maybe behind our custom URLs too?

- [ ] GET/PUT of JSON? That then updates the original files or data sources which then update the index?
