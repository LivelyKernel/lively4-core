<b>Wiki:</b> The Lively4 development environment allows all users to create new content and change the behavior of the environment itself. Those changes can be stored in browser local storage and published on GitHub. For publishing files on GitHub an OAuth authentication is used. Modified data and meta-data are stored on the server and on GitHub in git repositories. 
The authentication token will not be stored on the server, but is kept in browser local storage.
