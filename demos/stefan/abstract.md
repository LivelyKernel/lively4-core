## Context
*What is the broad context of the work? What is the importance of the general research area?*

- *rp* important/rp is a cornerstone for modern software development
- contemporary software
  - is interactive and reacts to user input, network messages and other events.
- by providing dedicated language concepts to describe constraints, data dependencies, cause-action relationships

## Inquiry
*What problem or question does the paper address? How has this problem or question been addressed by others (if at all)?*

- rpcs are challenging to implement
- in particular, *change detection* represents a hard but inevitable nessecity when integrating rpcs into oo host environments.
- even worse, change detection mechas are typically tightly coupled to the particular change resolution mechanism and, thus, not available for reuse.
- As a result, system developers have to re-implement similar strats over and over again.

## Approach/Knowledge
*What was done that unveiled new knowledge?*
*What new facts were uncovered? If the research was not results oriented, what new capabilities are enabled by the work?*

- In this thisis, we present **aexprs** as a reusable primitive for change detection in oo envs.
- aexprs abstract change detection for all rpcs that express their dependencies as oo expressions over program state and reify it into a programmable hook.
- Aexprs invoke assiciated behavior whenever the result of the monitored expression changes.
- Using this simple mechanism, aexprs act as a foundation when implementing rpcs.

## Grounding
*What argument, feasibility proof, artifacts, or results and evaluation support this work?*

- To show the feasibility of aexprs, we implement three different rpcs, signals, constraints, and roqs, using aexprs.
- For each concept, aexprs reduce the implementation effort in terms of amount of code required compared to traditional implementation techniques.

- Further, aexprs may even remove limitations imposed by traditional implementation techniques.
- We exemplify this capabilty byimplementing a push-based variant of implicit layer activation and combine it life-cycle callbacks for context-oriented pprogramming layers.

## Importance
*Why does this work matter?*

- Given these results, we hope that \aexprs will aid the development of novel \rpcs and improve system and application code alike.

Modern software development without \rp is hard to imagine.
\Rp favors a wide class of contemporary software systems that respond to user input, network messages, and other events.

\Rpcs are hard to implement.
One major hurdle is the change detection in object-oriented host environments.

%Research School Abstract:

%Reactive programming simplifies the implementation of complex, interconnected behavior by completely automating the propagation of changes. Researchers proposed a huge variety of approaches to execute on this initial idea. Most approaches present specialized solutions to maximize expressiveness and meet unique use cases. But usually, they are not intended for reuse. Thus, when implementing novel reactive concepts, developers often have to start from scratch.

%We identify a class of reactive programming concepts, \emph{state-based reactive programming}, that incorporates a common underlying change notification mechanism. Furthermore, we propose a reusable primitive, \emph{active expressions}, to facilitate the implementation of instances of this class of reactive concepts. Finally, we present an implementation of active expressions along with multiple strategies for state change monitoring.
