It works still in one repository, but when checking an annotation file out in a different location the git hashes can not be used to retrieve an actual text\n- Discussion: there we have it, history rewriting is **evil**\n- Idea: \n  - a) an `AnnotationSet` should keep the actual text as a copy (the most conservative approach)\n  - b) keep a reference to the last commit synced to GitGub. This will be helpfull in determining a common ancestor, if it comes to merge conflicts. \n  \n  \n  "}
