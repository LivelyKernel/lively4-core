# Issues


- should not complete in markdown... or should it?
- should cut intro and complete directly
- should complete longer pieces of code but only until end of component... e.g. complete class or complete method


## Future Work

- go beyond completing...
- more like personal assistant
- talk about code... explain things...
- overview of whole and big project
  - generate summaries
  - generate diagrams...
    - @boehmchen generate collaboration diagram of two classes
- challenge: give AI whole lively4 repository as context to reason about...
  - pre train model?
  - or just send a very long prompt?
