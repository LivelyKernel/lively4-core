- second
  - bla
  - foo
- third
- foo
- bar
## Subsection

Here comes some static `code`

```javascript

function foo(a) {
  return a * 2
}
```

And here a lively script

<script>

  var a = 3 + 4
  "a =" + a
</script>


### Example

![TestFigure](../../media/drawio "A figure created with drawio.")

And look also at Figure @fig:TestFigure

```javascript
var a = "hello"
```
