# Croquet

Croquet is a bit-identical synchronization system and helps the developer to write distributed systems with only client-side code and no server-side code to implementing collaborative multi-user applications. In Lively 4 different application scenarios were implemented to discuss the possibilities of Croquet. To do so and because we are using an external package it can only be alive inside an iFrame. <br>

Further information find in the [README](./README.md).
